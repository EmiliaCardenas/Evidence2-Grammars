# Korean Language Structure

## Overview
The most prominent links Korean to the Altaic languages of central Asia, a family that includes Turkish, Mongolian, and Siberia's Tungusic (for example, Manchu) languages. Others would argue for including Uralic languages (Hungarian and Finnish) and Japanese in this macro family. Although not definitively proven, this affiliation is accepted by most Korean linguists and deemed likely by Western linguists as well. The competing theory associates Korean with the Dravidian languages of southern India or with Austronesian languages. Determining Koreans' linguistic affiliation is complicated by a long history of contact with the Japanese and Chinese languages. Not surprisingly, Korean shares certain linguistic features with each of these languages.

## Korean Language Structure
Korean is an agglutinative language, meaning that it forms words and expresses grammatical relations by attaching particles or suffixes to a word. Some features include:

### Honorifics:
Korean has a system of honorifics that affects verb endings and vocabulary. The level of politeness and respect indicated by these forms is essential in conversations. If a person doesn’t use the proper honorifics, it can be disrespectful and create problems.

### No articles:
Korean does not use definite or indefinite articles. Needing to have context of the conversation to understand if something is plural or not, even the gender of a certain thing, the context is needed.

### Noun particles:
Korean uses particles attached to nouns to mark case roles, like subject, object, or location. Those help to know when certain nouns have ended and how they are used in the sentence.

### Verb-final:
Sentences in Korean typically end with a verb. The word order is subject-object-verb (SOV), which ends up with the idea of needing the whole sentence to understand. It’s improbable that the sentence is just the verb, and that way it can be understood.

## Nouns
Korean nouns can undergo changes depending on the grammatical case they are in. For plural formation, the language has some rules:

### General plural:
The plural form of most nouns is created by adding `들 (deul)` to the noun.

Example:
- 책 (chaek) = book → 책들 (chaekdeul) = books
- 사람 (saram) = person → 사람들 (saramdeul) = people

### Honorifics and Special Forms:
Some nouns, especially when referring to people or important things, have honorific versions.

Example:
- 어머니 (eomeoni) = mother → 어머님 (eomeonim) = respectful form of mother

## Verb Conjugation
Korean verbs are conjugated based on tense, politeness, and the subject's role in the sentence. The verb endings change depending on these factors:

### Politeness levels:
- **Formal polite:** Adding `-습니다 (seumnida)` or `-ㅂ니다 (bnida)`
  - Example: 먹다 (meokda, to eat, casual) → 먹습니다 (meokseumnida) = I eat (formal)
  
- **Informal polite:** Adding `-요 (yo)`
  - Example: 먹다 (meokda, informal) → 먹어요 (meogeoyo) = I eat (informal polite)

### Tenses:
- **Past:** Adding `-았/었/였 (at/ot/yot)` before the verb ending.
  - Example: 먹다 (meokda) → 먹었어요 (meogeosseoyo) = I ate

## Pronouns
Korean pronouns can be simple or honorific, based on the relationship between the speaker and the listener. That also influences the level of politeness during the conversation. Here are some examples:

- **I:** 나 (na, informal), 저 (jeo, formal)
- **You:** 너 (neo, informal), 당신 (dangsin, formal)

### Example Sentences
- **Casual:** 사람들은 책을 읽어요. (Saramdeureun chaegeul ilgeoyo.) = The people read books.
- **Honorific:** 어머니는 집에 계세요. (Eomeoni-neun jibe gyeseyo.) = My mother is at home (respectful form).

## Grammar
Korean has specific sentence structures, particularly with subject-object-verb (SOV) order and the use of particles to mark subjects, objects, and other sentence components. Additionally, Korean has various particles for case markers, topics, and conjunctions, which need to be incorporated into the grammar. For this case, we will focus on the most basic sentence structure.

### 1. Initial Structure
In Korean, sentences (S) often consist of noun phrases (NP) followed by verb phrases (VP). However, the subject, object, and verb are marked with particles. The structure to start with will be:

- S → NP_Subj NP_Obj VP
- S → NP_Subj VP
- S → NP_Obj VP
- S → VP

### 2. Noun Phrases and Verb Phrases
Noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP) break down as follows:

- **NP_Subj:** CR + SubjParticle
- **NP_Obj:** CR + ObjParticle
- **VP:** VerbStem + TenseMarker + PolitenessEnding

### 3. Verb and Noun Subcategories
The verb and noun elements are structured as:

- **VoR:** gada | meokda | masida | boda | malhada | saranghada
- **TenseMarker:** (empty) | at | eot
- **PolitenessEnding:** eoyo | seumnida

For nouns, we use common ones (CR), and their particles:

- **CR:** haksaeng | seonsaengnim | chingu | mul | jib | haksang | kpop | aideol | eumak | norae | albom
- **NP_Subj:** eun | neun | i | ga
- **NP_Obj:** eul | reul

### 4. Other Elements
For giving and ending in the creation of the sentences, there are some details like verb suffixes (VoE) and particles (EE):

- **VoE:** neun | eul | reul | ga | i
- **EE:** wa | gwa | do | eseo
  
### 5. Conjunctions
Conjunctions help add more information to the sentences:

- **Conj:** geurigo | ttoneun | hajiman | wae냐하면
